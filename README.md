Audio Visualization using WebAudio API and WebGL with Three.js.

Written in CoffeeScript and built referencing Justin Windle's codepen: http://codepen.io/soulwire/pen/Dscga
Check out Justin's site for some awesome experiments: http://soulwire.co.uk

I like this piece of music for this experiment because I think the electronic and percussive sounds make for some very satisfying choreography.

Music by Jon Hopkins - "Small Memory, Tunng Remix"
